## Data and code for BC Pacific Spiny Dogfish operating models

- Raw datasets from PBS databases are in `data/raw`.
- Derived datasets are in `data/generated`.
- Analysis scripts are in `analysis`.
- Geostatistical indexes are pushed in `data/generated` so the corresponding scripts in `analysis` can be skipped.
