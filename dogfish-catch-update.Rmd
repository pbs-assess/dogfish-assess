# Objectives

1. Summarize changes to the catch data since the RPR meeting

1. Communicate plan for handling longline/trap discard count data

1. Answer questions / discuss any issues with the catch data

1. Gain consensus on catch data for Working Paper / SAR revisions

---

# Data comparison

- I compared the catch data as presented at the RPR meeting from 1996-2023 for trawl and 2006--023 for longline and trap gear against a separate SQL query built by Maria Cornthwaite

- Maria's query pulled from `PacHarHL`, `PacHarvSable`, and `GFFOS` databases (`Official_Catch` tables)

- Original RPR data came from `GF_MERGED_CATCH` table in `GFFOS` database

- Data are identical after some minor changes to original data...

---

# Data changes

- Hook and line, longline, and trap discarded counts have been used instead of weight. This issue was identified at the RPR meeting.

---

# Data changes

- Discard weights from the midwater trawl fleet have been added from 1996 to 2006

```

---

# Data changes

- DFO Statistical Area 12 so 3CD5ABCDE catch reflects Pacific Fisheries Management Area (PFMA) areas rather than the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) areas
- Has a very minor effect on catches.

```{r, out.width="90%"}
include_graphics(here::here("figs/longline-unsorted-weight.png"))
```

---

#  Summed discard weights (illustrative only)

- *If* released dogfish weigh 3.07 kg (6.77 lbs) (average)
- Based on unsorted longline samples in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013
- Include in SAR/Res Doc figs or show counts only?

```{r, out.width="75%"}
include_graphics(here::here("analysis/knitr-figs-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png"))
```

---

# Plan

- Update catch data files

- Model longline and trap discards as counts

- Use average "dead dogfish" weight ratios in final 5 years to set "dead dogfish" ratios for projections

- Rerun models and finish revisions

- Include brief summary of what was shown here in Res Doc

- Include catch table at least for 1996 onwards (trawl) and 2006 onwards (longline/trap)
