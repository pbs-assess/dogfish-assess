- Estimated unfished vulnerable biomass (BC to Oregon) of 200,000 t from Delury and Leslie depletion models

- Assumed pup survival and recruitment was density-independent

- M = 0.094, solved from the maturity and fecundity schedule

- MSY was estimated to be 9,000–11,000 t where MSY = FMSY $\times$ 200,000 and FMSY = 0.5 M

- Natural mortality proposed as density-dependent mechanism for yield curve

- Alternative hypotheses of density-dependent growth and fecundity deemed biologically implausible to achieve the proposed MSY value

##  Assessment history: Saunders 1980s

.small[
- Wood et al. 1979 model updated by Saunders in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1989

- 1989 catch recommendations were for Alaska–California stock:
  - 9,000 t = "low risk"
  - 9,000–14,000 t = "high risk" (of declines)

- Basis for current TAC with some adjustments

- Saunders 1989 assumed BC was 1/2 to 2/3 of stock
  - therefore, 4,500–9,333 t was "high risk"

- Surplus production model

- Catch data from longline and trawl fisheries; commercial CPUE, IPHC, NMFS Triennial survey, HS MSA survey indices
  
- Synoptic trawl and HBLL surveys too short at the time

- Challenges with parameter estimation

- "No consensus reached on a scientifically valid approach on which to base yield recommendations"

- Reduction in the size distribution, long generation time, low fecundity, uncertainty in population trends, vulnerability elsewhere resulted in COSEWIC "Special Concern" in 2011

#  Overview 

.xsmall[
Sex segregated age-structured population model (Stock Synthesis 3) fitted to fishery & survey catch, indices, and size composition. McAllister-Ianelli algorithm to downweight the sample sizes of size composition.

Estimated selectivity, unfished recruitment, and stock-recruit productivity.

Adjust maturity ogive for two year gestation period. On average, half of mature females give birth annually.

No recruitment deviations (cohorts not observable from length data).

In essence, a production model informed by catch and indices, while size composition informs selectivity.

Age-structure incorporates lags in stock response to exploitation pattern (selectivity and fishing mortality).
]

---
##  A stock-recruit curve for Dogfish-like species 

Low fecundity limits stock productivity. Example to illustrate:

Imagine an unfished population N = 100 adults, which produce 10 pups/adult, that's 1,000 pups (B0). If pup survival to recruit life stage is 0.6, then we have 600 recruits (R0).

A population of N = 20 (0.2 B0) produces 200 pups. If steepness were 1 in a closed population, we'd have to conjure 600 recruits from 200 pups.

Thus, in this example, steepness should be capped at 0.33: 200 pups at 0.2B0 divided by 600 pups when unfished.

---
#  Dogfish stock recruit relationship

\begin{aligned}
R_y &= S_y \times \exp\left(-z_0 + (z_0 - z_\mathrm{min})\left(1 - \frac{S_y}{S_0}\right)^\beta\right)\\
z_\mathrm{min} &= z_0(1 - z_\mathrm{frac})\\
z_0 &= -\log(1/\phi_0)
\end{aligned}

.xsmall[
$S_y$ is the spawning output (number of pups). The exponent is the survival (density-dependent = survival increases as depletion $S_y/S_0$ is decreases).

$z_\mathrm{frac}$ is the proportion of unfished density dependent mortality when stock&nbsp;→&nbsp;zero (0–1, higher = more productive stock)

$\beta$ controls concavity in density dependent mortality as stock declines (1&nbsp;=&nbsp;linear)

### Why spawning output instead of spawning biomass?

- Provides a more direct measure of stock productivity and we can better estimate it than for most teleost fish.

--

- For teleost fish, spawning biomass is typically used as a proxy for spawning output (egg production) since more direct information about fecundity is unavailable.

--

- Fecundity of Dogfish is comparatively well known (2–16 pups depending on size; Ketchen 1968).

--

- Therefore, spawning output (number of pups) is commonly used for reference points for long-lived low-fecundity species such as sharks.


---

# Why depletion-based reference points?


.pull-left[
- Shape of yield curve with respect to depletion across values of stock-recruit $z_\mathrm{frac}$ and $\beta$ relatively constant

- But height of curves (MSY) varies strongly

#  COSEWIC Considerations

# COSEWIC criteria

COSEWIC Metric A measures the probability that the stock has declined by 70%, 50%, or 30% "over the last 10 years or 3 generations, whichever is longer", but is also interpreted as a decline over the longest time series available. 

--

We define the generation time as 1/M + age at 50% maturity. I.e., about 50 years.

--

Entire assessment (1937 = 2023, 86 years) = ~1.7 generations.

--

We can also look at just the population indices.

.small[
Dogfish are subject to DFO's Precautionary Approach (PA) Framework under the Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF).
]

.small[
The PA Framework: "when a stock has reached the Critical Zone [below the LRP], a rebuilding plan must be in place with the aim of having a high probability of the stock growing out of the Critical Zone within a reasonable timeframe."
]

--

.small[
Guidelines:
"a 'reasonable timeframe' for a stock to grow above its LRP should be between 1.5 to 2 times the generation time. However, for some stocks a longer time may be needed to reach its rebuilding target, for example due to a stock's highly depleted state or its current productivity."

#  Improvements over previous assessment 

Introduction of new population indices: HBLL + Synoptic trawl indices (~20 years) with strong trends that were not yet apparent

Surplus production model → age-structured model

- Lets us evaluate population trajectories consistent with understanding of Dogfish growth, maturity, fecundity, and stock-recruit productivity that are also consistent with length composition and index data.

- Can incorporate lags in the population response to fishing due to late maturity and low fecundity.

##  Challenge: can't fit all indices simultaneously

.xsmall[
- Not possible to simultaneously obtain a good fit to all three modern indices
- Synoptic survey believed to target preferred Dogfish habitat (muddy bottom) but IPHC index is more precise (mixed substrates)
- Commercial CPUE and IPHC index less steep

- HBLL shallower, in rocky habitat, in August?
- No explanation for Synoptic trawl index

##  Perception of depletion was relatively robust 

- Estimated current status is inferred from the decline in indices in light of low catches relative to historical levels.

- Low fecundity, late maturity, 2-year gestation limits the range of potential historical population trajectories among the sensitivity scenarios

#  Environmental Considerations 

---
### Environmental conditions not explicitly modeled 

But modelled time-varying natural mortality, e.g. from changes to predation

Unclear how plausible these modelled changes in natural mortality are

Dogfish "integrate" over many years of environmental condition (Taylor and Galluci 2009)

---
#  Environmentally driven movement? 

.xlarge[
1. Movement north?

2. Movement offshore?

3. Movement seasonally?
]

---
#  Movement north? 

- Increases in water temperature could cause Dogfish to move north to Alaska causing declines in our survey indices.

--

- However, English et al. (2021) did not find any strong correlations between local changes in temperature and oxygen and changes to dogfish distribution.

--

- Dogfish have a wide thermal tolerance.

--

- Most importantly, Dogfish have declined in the Gulf of Alaska over the last 20 years as well.

---
#  Movement offshore? 

- If stock moved offshore outside of survey domains, could cause index declines.

--
- But, the trawl survey (and commercial CPUE) already extend deeper than Dogfish are typically found.

--
- We don't see increases further offshore; however, there *is* evidence of less steep declines in deeper waters...

# Conclusions

Taken together, we do not observe compelling evidence of northward, offshore, or seasonal shifts in distribution that would explain the majority of the declines in the indices of Dogfish biomass or abundance.

--

Regardless of the cause (recent fishing, legacy fishing effect, increase in natural mortality, movement), there are considerably fewer Dogfish in BC outside waters than there were 20 years ago when surveys began.

---
# Conclusions

The stock is estimated to be around 0.1 B<sub>0</sub> and below an LRP of 0.2 B<sub>0</sub>.

--

It's unclear which model is most plausible in terms of how catch will affect the stock, but even the most optimistic scenarios suggest catches would need to be much lower than the current TAC.

#  Research Recommendations

#  Research recommendations 

Current data streams (although important) are unlikely to substantially improve our understanding of BC Dogfish in the near future

--

Develop coastwide picture of changes in Dogfish abundance and distribution

--

Examine Steller and California sea lion diet

--

Aging of modern samples

--

Close-kin mark-recapture?

---
#  Timeline to revisit assessment 

Recommended around 5 years

Stock is assessed below LRP

But slow life history—unlikely to rapidly change

Increase in small dogfish in SYN WCVI survey?

May behave in unexpected ways given we were unable to fit full decline for 2 surveys
