##  Assessment history: Wood et al. 1979

.small[
- Estimated unfished vulnerable biomass (BC to Oregon) of 200,000 tonnes from Delury and Leslie depletion models

- Assumed pup survival and recruitment was density-independent

- M = 0.094, solved from the maturity and fecundity schedule

- MSY was estimated to be 9,000–11,000 t where MSY = FMSY $\times$ 200,000 and FMSY = 0.5 M

- Natural mortality proposed as density-dependent mechanism for yield curve

- Alternative hypotheses of density-dependent growth and fecundity deemed biologically implausible to achieve the proposed MSY value
]


---

##  Assessment history: Saunders 1980s

.small[
- Wood et al. 1979 model updated by Saunders in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1989

- 1989 catch recommendations were for Alaska–California stock:
  - 9,000 t = "low risk"
  - 9,000–14,000 t = "high risk" (of declines)

- Basis for current TAC

- Saunders 1989 assumed BC was 1/2 to 2/3 of stock
  - therefore, 4,500–9,333 t was "high risk"
]

##  Assessment history: Gallucci et al. 2010

.small[
- Surplus production model

- Catch data from longline and trawl fisheries; commercial CPUE, IPHC, NMFS Triennial survey, HS MSA survey indices
  
- Synoptic trawl and HBLL surveys too short at the time

- Challenges with parameter estimation

- "no consensus reached on a scientifically valid approach on which to base yield recommendations"

- Reduction in the size distribution, long generation time, low fecundity, uncertainty in population trends, vulnerability elsewhere resulted in COSEWIC "Special Concern" in 2011

#  Nearby assessments: US West Coast

- Similar vitamin A fishery history

market developed for Dogfish)

- Estimated at 34% of unfished spawning output (above overfished threshold of 25% but below target of 40%)

- Overfishing estimated during vitamin A fishery and in 1980s–early 1990s

- Similar data and SS3 model to what we will present here for BC; similar challenges

- Use delta-lognormal or negative binomial observation error

- Predict on grid covering survey each year; sum density across grid

#  Population Dynamics Model

#  Overview 

.xsmall[
Sex segregated age-structured population model (Stock Synthesis 3) fitted to fishery & survey catch, indices, and size composition. McAllister-Ianelli algorithm to downweight the sample sizes of size composition.

Estimated selectivity, unfished recruitment, and stock-recruit productivity.

Adjust maturity ogive for two year gestation period. On average, half of mature females give birth annually.

No recruitment deviations (cohorts not observable from length data).

In essence, a production model informed by catch and indices, while size composition informs selectivity. <br>Age-structure incorporates lags in stock response to exploitation pattern (selectivity and fishing mortality).
]

---
#  A need for a stock-recruit curve for Dogfish-like species 

Low fecundity limits stock productivity. Example to illustrate:

Imagine an unfished population N = 100 adults, which produce 10 pups/adult, that's 1,000 pups (B0).

A population of N = 20 (0.2 B0) produces 200 pups. If steepness were 1 in a closed population, we'd have to conjure 600 recruits from 200 pups.

Thus, in this example, steepness should be capped at 0.33: 200 pups at 0.2B0 divided by 600 pups when unfished.

---
#  Dogfish stock recruit relationship

\begin{aligned}
R_y &= S_y \times \exp\left(-z_0 + (z_0 - z_\mathrm{min})\left(1 - \frac{S_y}{S_0}\right)^\beta\right)\\
z_\mathrm{min} &= z_0(1 - z_\mathrm{frac})\\
z_0 &= -\log(1/\phi_0)
\end{aligned}

.xsmall[
$S_y$ is the spawning output (number of pups). The exponent is the survival (density-dependent = survival increases as depletion $S_y/S_0$ is decreases).

$z_\mathrm{frac}$ is the proportion of unfished density dependent mortality when stock → zero (0–1, higher = more productive stock)

$\beta$ controls concavity in density dependent mortality as stock declines (1 = linear)

## Why spawning output over spawning biomass?

- Provides a more direct measure of stock productivity and we can better estimate it than for most teleost fish.

--

- For teleost fish, spawning biomass is typically used as a proxy for spawning output (egg production) since more direct information about fecundity is unavailable.

--

- Fecundity of Dogfish is comparatively well known (2–16 pups depending on size; Ketchen 1968).

--

- Therefore, spawning output (number of pups) is commonly used for reference points for long-lived low-fecundity species such as sharks.

# Why depletion-based reference points?


.pull-left[
- Shape of yield curve with respect to depletion across values of stock-recruit $z_\mathrm{frac}$ and $\beta$ relatively constant

- But height of curves (MSY) varies strongly

#  COSEWIC Considerations

# COSEWIC criteria

COSEWIC Metric A measures the probability that the stock has declined by 70%, 50% or 30% "over the last 10 years or 3 generations, whichever is longer", but is also interpreted as a decline over the longest time series available. 

--

We define the generation time as 1/M + age at 50% maturity. I.e., 1/0.065 + 33.5 = ~50 years.

--

Entire assessment (1937 = 2023, 86 years) = ~1.7 generations.

--

We can also look at just the population indices.

# Rebuilding Considerations 

.small[
Dogfish are subject to DFO's Precautionary Approach (PA) Framework under the Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF).
]

--

.small[
The PA Framework: "when a stock has reached the Critical Zone [below the LRP], a rebuilding plan must be in place with the aim of having a high probability of the stock growing out of the Critical Zone within a reasonable timeframe."
]

--

.small[
Guidelines:
"a 'reasonable timeframe' for a stock to grow above its LRP should be between 1.5 to 2 times the generation time. However, for some stocks a longer time may be needed to reach its rebuilding target, for example due to a stock's highly depleted state or its current productivity."

#  Discussion 

---
#  Improvements over previous assessment 

- Introduction of new population indices: HBLL + Synoptic trawl indices (~20 years) with strong trends that were not yet apparent

--

- Surplus production model → age-structured model

- An age-structured model lets us evaluate population trajectories consistent with understanding of Dogfish growth, maturity, fecundity, and stock-recruit productivity while also fitting the length composition and index data.

- Age-structured models can incorporate lags in the population response due to late maturity and low fecundity.

---
##  Challenges fitting some population indices 


---
##  Perception of depletion was relatively robust 

- Estimated current status is inferred from the decline in indices in light of low catches relative to historical levels.

#  Environmental Considerations 

---
#  Environmental conditions not explicitly modeled 

- But modelled time-varying natural mortality

- Dogfish "integrate" over many years of environmental condition (Taylor and Galluci 2009)

- English et al. (2021) did not find any strong patterns in changes to outside BC Dogfish distribution correlated with local changes to bottom temperature or dissolved oxygen

---
#  Environmentally driven movement? 

- Movement north?

- Movement offshore?

- Movement seasonally?

---
#  Movement north? 

- Increases in water temperature could cause Dogfish to move north to Alaska causing declines in our survey indices.

--

- However, English et al. (2021) did not find any strong correlations between local changes in temperature and oxygen and changes to dogfish distribution.

--

- Dogfish have a wide thermal tolerance already.

--

- Most importantly, Dogfish have declined in the Gulf of Alaska over the last 20 years as well...

---
#  Movement offshore? 

- If stock moved offshore outside of survey domains, could cause decline in indices.

--

- But, the trawl survey (and commercial CPUE) already extend deeper than Dogfish are typically found and we don't see evidence of increases further offshore.

--

- Although there *is* evidence of steeper declines in shallow waters...

#  Environmentally driven movement? 

* Taken together, we do not observe compelling evidence of northward, offshore, or seasonal shifts in distribution that would explain the majority of the declines in the indices of Dogfish biomass or abundance.

--

* Regardless of cause, there are fewer Dogfish in BC outside waters than there were 20 years ago when surveys began.

#  Research recommendations 

* Current data streams (although important) are unlikely to substantially improve our understanding of BC Dogfish in the near future

--

* Develop coastwide picture of changes in Dogfish abundance and distribution

--

* Examine Steller and California sea lion diet

--

* Aging of modern samples

--

* Close-kin mark-recapture?

---
#  Timeline to revisit assessment 

* Recommended around 5 years

* Stock is assessed below LRP

* But slow life history—unlikely to rapidly change

* Increase in small dogfish in SYN WCVI survey?

* May behave in unexpected ways given we were unable to fit full decline for 2 surveys

* Monitor in groundfish data synopsis report
