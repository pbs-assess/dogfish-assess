### Wood et al. 1979:

.small[
- Estimated unfished vulnerable biomass (BC to Oregon) of 200,000 tonnes from Delury and Leslie depletion models
- Assumed pup survival and recruitment was density-independent.
- M = 0.094, solved from the maturity and fecundity schedule
- MSY was estimated to be 9-11 thousand tonnes where MSY = FMSY * 200,000 and FMSY = 0.5 M
- Natural mortality was proposed as the density-dependent mechanism for the yield curve.
- Alternative hypotheses of density-dependent growth and fecundity were biologically implausible to achieve the proposed MSY value.

#  Population Dynamics Model

---
#  A need for a stock-recruit curve for Dogfish-like species 

Unfished population N = 100 adults, which produce 10 pups/adult, that's 1,000 pups (B0).

If density-dependent unfished pup survival is 0.6, then we get 600 recruits (R0).

A population of N = 20 (0.2 B0) produces 200 pups. If steepness were 1 in a closed population, we'd have to conjure 600 recruits from 200 pups.

Thus, in this example, steepness is capped at 0.33: 200 pups at 0.2B0 divided by 600 pups when unfished.

---
#  Dogfish stock recruit relationship

\begin{aligned}
R_y &= S_y \times \exp\left(-z_0 + (z_0 - z_\mathrm{min})\left(1 - \frac{S_y}{S_0}\right)^\beta\right)\\
z_\mathrm{min} &= z_0(1 - z_\mathrm{frac})\\
z_0 &= -\log(1/\phi_0)
\end{aligned}

$z_\mathrm{frac}$ is the proportion of unfished density dependent mortality when stock → zero (0–1, higher = more productive stock)

$\beta$ controls concavity in density dependent mortality as stock declines (1 = linear)

#  COSEWIC Considerations

# COSEWIC criteria

COSEWIC Metric A measures the probability that the stock has declined by 70%, 50% or 30% "over the last 10 years or 3 generations, whichever is longer", but is also interpreted as a decline over the longest time series available. 

We define the generation time as 1/M + age at 50% maturity. I.e., 1/0.065 + 33.5 = ~50 years

Entire assessment (1937 = 2023, 86 years) = ~1.7 generations.

# Rebuilding Considerations 

.small[
Dogfish are subject to DFO's Precautionary Approach (PA) Framework under the Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF).
]

--

.small[
The PA Framework: "when a stock has reached the Critical Zone [below the LRP], a rebuilding plan must be in place with the aim of having a high probability of the stock growing out of the Critical Zone within a reasonable timeframe."
]

--

.small[
Guidelines:
"a 'reasonable timeframe' for a stock to grow above its LRP should be between 1.5 to 2 times the generation time. However, for some stocks a longer time may be needed to reach its rebuilding target, for example due to a stock's highly depleted state or its current productivity."

#  Discussion

#  Challenges fitting some population indices

#  Perception of depletion was relatively robust 

- Estimated current status is inferred from the decline in indices in light of low catches relative to historical levels.
 
- TODO

#  Mortality on juvenile Dogfish in the trawl discards 



---
class: center, middle, inverse
#  Environmental Considerations 

---
#  Environmental conditions not explicitly modeled 

- But modelled time-varying natural mortality

- Dogfish "integrate" over many years of environmental condition (Taylor and Galluci 2009)

- English et al. (2021) did not find any strong patterns in changes to outside BC Dogfish distribution correlated with local changes to bottom temperature or dissolved oxygen

---
#  Environmentally driven movement? 

- Movement north?

- Movement offshore?

- Movement seasonally?

---
#  Movement north? 

- Increases in water temperature could cause Dogfish to move north to Alaska causing declines in our survey indices.

--

- However, English et al. (2021) did not find any strong correlations between local changes in temperature and oxygen and changes to dogfish distribution.

--

- Dogfish have a wide thermal tolerance already.

--

- Most importantly, Dogfish have declined in the Gulf of Alaska over the last 20 years as well...

---
#  Trawl survey declines are coastwide 

```{r, out.width="600px", eval=FALSE}
include_graphics("assets/img/image58.png")
```

.xsmall[Davidson et al. In prep.]

---
#  Movement offshore? 

- If stock moved offshore outside of survey domains, could cause decline in indices.

--

- But, the trawl survey (and commercial CPUE) already extend deeper than Dogfish are typically found and we don't see evidence of increases further offshore.

--

- Although there *is* evidence of steeper declines in shallow waters...

---
#  Steeper commercial CPUE declines in shallow areas, but still declining in deeper waters

#  Environmentally driven movement? 

* Taken together, we do not observe compelling evidence of northward, offshore, or seasonal shifts in distribution that would explain the majority of the declines in the indices of Dogfish biomass or abundance.

--

* Regardless of cause, there are fewer Dogfish in BC outside waters than there were 20 years ago when surveys began.

#  Research recommendations 

* Current data streams (although important) are unlikely to substantially improve our understanding of BC Dogfish in the near future

--

* Develop coastwide picture of changes in Dogfish abundance and distribution

* Examine Steller and California sea lion diet

--

* Aging of modern samples

--

* Close-kin mark-recapture?

---
#  Timeline to revisit assessment 

* Recommended around 5 years

* Stock is assessed below LRP

* But slow life history—unlikely to rapidly change

* Increase in small dogfish in SYN WCVI survey?

* May behave in unexpected ways given we were unable to fit full decline for 2 surveys

* Monitor in groundfish data synopsis report
