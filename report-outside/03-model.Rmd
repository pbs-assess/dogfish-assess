# Population Dynamics Model

The historical abundance of Outside Pacific spiny dogfish was re-constructed through Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3), version 3.30.21 [@methot2013]. 
The two-sex, age structured population model was fit to fishery and survey catch, indices of abundance, and length composition from both fisheries and surveys.

## Biological parameters

Sex-specific biological parameters were estimated from biological samples and fixed in the population model.
Estimates from biological samples are presented in Appendix \@ref(app:growth), and the values imported into the SS3 control file are presented in Table \@ref(tab:ss3-par).

Age samples were collected from various surveys, tag returns, and some fisheries.
Growth was described with a von Bertalanffy function, and several growth fits were explored.
There was notably high variation around the mean length-age relationship. 
Several factors likely contribute to this behavior, including ageing error and cessation of annular ring deposition in pregnant females.
Further discussion is provided in Appendix \@ref(app:growth).

Age samples in BC were not collected for the youngest dogfish, i.e., less than 5 years, resulting in a large negative value for the $a_0$ parameter, theoretical age at size zero.
When fitted with age samples from both BC and the 2010 Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) bottom trawl survey [@gertseva2021], the growth curve for Outside dogfish had a more appropriate $a_0$ estimate, such that the size of newborn age-0 dogfish was approximately 20--30 cm.
This is the range of uterine pup sizes observed near the end of the gestational period [@ketchen1972].
This was primary growth curve used in the modeling was estimated primarily from age samples collected in BC, termed "BC growth".

Variability in length-at-age decreased as age increased.
Based on the lognormal residual standard deviation by age and sex in the fitted von Bertalanffy model (BC growth curve), the population model was configured so that the coefficient of variation (CV) in length at age linearly decreases from 0.25 to 0.075 for ages 0 to 40, respectively, for females.
For males, the CV at age was slightly larger, where the decrease was from 0.25 to 0.1 for ages 0 to 40, respectively. The CV remained constant for ages 40 and above.

An alternative growth curve was also explored from age samples collected in Washington and estimated in the 2021 U.S. assessment, termed "US growth".
Compared to the primary growth curve, the alternative describes a larger but slower growing animal (Figure \@ref(fig:len-age)).

Weight at length was estimated from survey samples in outside waters.

Maturity at age estimates were obtained from the literature and shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mat-age) [@mcfarlane1987; @taylor2013]. 
Maturity at length was also estimated from biological samples in the synoptic survey (Appendix \@ref(app:growth)). 
For the age-structured model, conversion of maturity at size to maturity at age values is dependent on the length-age function (Figure \@ref(fig:mat-age)). 
The conversion used a length-age key, a probability matrix, where the probability of length given age follows a Gaussian distribution with the mean from the von Bertalanffy equation and standard deviation from the CV in length-at-age.

Due to uncertainty in the growth curve, and to facilitate sensitivity analyses, maturity was explicitly parameterized with respect to age in the population model.
Two ogives were considered.
The maturity at age ogive from @taylor2009 with early maturity (samples in the 2000s) was used as the base scenario, where the ages of 50 and 95 percent female maturity were 31.5 and 55.8 years, respectively.
This ogive most closely resembled the maturity at length ogive from the synoptic survey (Figure \@ref(fig:mat-age)).
The second maturity at age ogive from @mcfarlane1987, which sampled dogfish in the Strait of Georgia, was used in an alternative scenario. The maturity schedule consists of slightly older females, where the ages of 50 and 95 percent female maturity were 35.5 and 45 years, respectively.
Male maturity was not modeled it is assumed that female abundance is the limiting factor in the spawning output of the population.

To accommodate the two year gestation period for dogfish pups, the maturity ogive input into the model was set to half of their original values, i.e., with a maximum of 0.5 for any age class.
In this manner, half of the mature population on average is calculated to produce young in a given year.

Fecundity estimates $f$ were obtained from @ketchen1972, where the number of pups is a linear function of length $\ell$, with $f_\ell = 0.20 \ell - 13.24$ (Figure \@ref(fig:fec-age)).
On average, females produce 6--7 young per litter.
No fecundity at age estimates are available, so the model internally converts values from the fecundity at length schedule through the length-age key.

Natural mortality was indirectly estimated to be 0.074 year^-1^ from the maximum observed age of 73 years (female) in the age samples, using the meta-analytic estimator in @hamel2022, where $M = 5.4/a_\textrm{max}$.
The oldest male was 70 years.
Given similar longevity between sexes, natural mortality was sex-invariant in the model.

## Model structure

The base model estimated the unfished recruitment in log-space $\log(R_0)$, productivity parameter $z_\textrm{frac}$, and selectivity parameters for the various fisheries and surveys (Table \@ref(tab:ss3-par)).
No recruitment deviates were estimated since no information about cohort strength was evident in the size composition.
Preliminary models estimated recruitment deviates that were deemed to be spurious because they did not change the fit and stock estimates compared to those in simpler models without deviates.

The start year of the model was 1937, when it was assumed that the stock was in an unfished state, and the terminal year was 2023. 
The maximum age in the model wa 70 years.

Model equations are provided in Table \@ref(tab:ss3-eq).

### Stock-recruit relationship

An explicit survival-based stock-recruit relationship (SRR) was used in the model, where recruitment $R$ in year $y$ is

$$
R_y = S_y \times \exp\left(-z_0 + (z_0 - z_\textrm{min})\left(1 - \frac{S_y}{S_0}\right)^\beta\right)
$$ 

where $S_y$ is the spawning output in year $y$, $S_0 = R_0\times\phi_0$ is the unfished spawning output as the product of unfished recruitment $R_0$ and spawning output per recruit $\phi_0$, $z_\textrm{min} = z_0(1 - z_\textrm{frac})$, and $z_0 = -\log(1/\phi_0)$. 

The inverse of spawning output per recruit $\phi_0$ is the unfished replacement line and is intrepretable as the survival of pups to the recruit life stage when the stock is at unfished levels.
The term in the exponent is the corresponding instantaneous mortality rate (exponentiation converts the instantaneous rate to a survival term between 0--1).
Since the term describes the density-dependent mechanism in the population, the pup-recruit mortality rate decreases as the stock declines.
The symbol $z_0$ is the instantaneous rate when the stock is at $S_0$.
The symbol $z_\textrm{min}$ is the mortality rate as the stock approaches zero, and is parameterized as a $z_\textrm{frac}$ proportion of $z_0$, i.e., $z_\textrm{min} = z_0(1 - z_\textrm{frac})$.
When $\beta = 1$, the decline in the density-dependent mortality rate is linear with stock size.
As $z_\textrm{frac}$ approaches zero, the mortality rate is independent of stock size, i.e., there is no density-dependence.

Steepness, the recruitment relative to $R_0$ when the stock is at $0.2 S_0$, is calculated as 

$$
h = 0.2\exp(z_0 z_\textrm{frac}(1-0.2^\beta))
$$

Due to the longevity and low fecundity of dogfish, and many elasmobranch species in general, there are upper bounds to the maximum per-capita rate of recruitment in a closed population.
The spawning output is measured in the number of pups, and the recruitment after density-dependent survival cannot exceed the pup production  [@forrest2009; @taylor2013; @deoliveira2013].
As a result, there is an implied upper bound to steepness, where steepness cannot exceed $1/(5\phi_0)$ [@taylor2013].

This upper bound can be illustrated with a simple example. 
If the unfished population is 100 females that each produce 10 pups, then $S_0 = 1000$. If the pup survival is 0.6 ($1/\phi_0 = 0.6$), then the recruitment $R_0 = 600$. 
At 20 percent of unfished, the population of 20 females produces 200 pups, which is also the maximum recruitment if pup survival were to be one.
The maximum steepness is 0.33 (200/600).

The unfished spawning output per recruit $\phi_0$ is calculated from natural mortality, maturity, and fecundity. Low fecundity implies an upper limit to natural mortality because $\phi_0$ must remain above one.
With high natural mortality, it is possible to calculate $\phi_0 < 1$, which implies that a female cannot produce enough offspring over the course of her lifetime to replace herself.

### Selectivity

Selectivity at length was modeled using a double Gaussian formulation. 

If female selectivity is dome shaped, then selectivity was parameterized with three parameters that control the size of full selectivity ($\mu^\textrm{Female}$), the width of the ascending limb ($\Delta^\textrm{Female, asc}$), and the width of the descending limb ($\Delta^\textrm{Female, dsc}$).
If female selectivity is flat-topped, then the descending limb parameter was fixed to $\Delta^\textrm{Female, dsc} = 15$ which set selectivity to be effectively 1 at lengths greater than $\mu^\textrm{Female}$.

Female selectivity at length $v_\ell$ was

$$
v_\ell^\textrm{Female} = 
\begin{cases}
\exp\left(\dfrac{-(\ell - \mu^\textrm{Female})^2}{\exp(\Delta^\textrm{Female, asc})}\right) \quad & \ell \le \mu^\textrm{Female}\\
\exp\left(\dfrac{-(\ell - \mu^\textrm{Female})^2}{\exp(\Delta^\textrm{Female, dsc})}\right) \quad & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Four additional selectivity parameters were estimated for males, with three parameters controlling the shape of the selectivity curve, as an offset from the corresponding female parameter, and a fourth parameter ($A^\textrm{Male}$) that specifies the relative apical selectivity (between 0-1).

Male selectivity at length was

$$
v_\ell^\textrm{Male} = 
A^\textrm{Male} \times
\begin{cases}
\exp\left(\dfrac{-(\ell - [\mu^\textrm{Female}+\mu^\textrm{Male}])^2}{\exp(\Delta^\textrm{Female, asc} + \Delta^\textrm{Male, asc})}\right) \quad & \ell \le \mu^\textrm{Female} + \mu^\textrm{Male}\\
\exp\left(\dfrac{-(\ell - \mu^\textrm{Female})^2}{\exp(\Delta^\textrm{Female, dsc} + \Delta^\textrm{Male, dsc})}\right) \quad & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The corresponding selectivity at age are obtained through the length-age key (Table \@ref(tab:ss3-eq)).

## Model fitting

The estimated parameters for the stock-recruit relationship are $\log(R_0)$ and $z_\textrm{frac}$.
A uniform prior was used for the $\log(R_0)$ parameter with a lower bound of 9 and upper bound of 15. 
A beta prior was used for $z_\textrm{frac}$ with mean of 0.5 and standard deviation of 0.287, corresponding to a symmetrical, weakly informative prior with slightly lower prior density at the bounds of 0 and 1.
The mean and standard deviation corresponds to beta distribution parameters $\alpha = 1.01$ and $\beta = 0.01$.

For fisheries and/or surveys with length composition, six parameters were estimated if the female selectivity was assumed to be flat-topped or seven parameters if dome-shaped.
From the length composition (summed across all years), the modal length $L_\textrm{mode}$ was used as the prior mean for the female length of full selectivity $\mu^\textrm{Female}$.
The prior mean for for the male length of full selectivity $\mu^\textrm{Male}$ was the difference between the modal lengths in the female and male length composition. 
For both sexes, the standard deviation of the prior was set to 30 percent of the mean.
A normal distribution was used for both parameters.

The $\Delta$ control the selectivity limbs and are estimated in logspace. They were estimated assuming a normal prior distribution with a prior standard deviation of 0.3.
The length at the 5th percentile $L_\textrm{5\%}$ of the length composition, i.e., from the empirical cumulative distribution function, was used to calculate the prior mean of $\Delta^\textrm{Female, asc}$ was set to $\log(L_\textrm{mode} - L_\textrm{5\%})$. 
$\Delta$ are logspace parameters, estimated with a prior standard deviation of 0.3.
If dome selectivity was assumed, then the prior mean of $\Delta^\textrm{Female, dsc}$ was set to $\log(L_\textrm{95\%} - L_\textrm{mode})$, where $L_\textrm{95\%}$ is the size at the 95th percentile of the length composition. 
The process was repeated for the male parameters, where the difference in female and male values was used as the prior mean for the males, since these parameters are estimated as offsets.

For fisheries and surveys without length data, selectivity was mirrored, i.e., borrowed from other fisheries and surveys in the model.
The fleet structure of the fisheries in the model was broadly organized in terms of fishing gear and retention behavior (landings vs. discards), due to the differences in length composition upon visual inspection.
For example, trawl landings comprised primarily of large females while trawl discards comprised of smaller animals with an even sex ratio.

The following fleets were modeled:

1. Bottom Trawl Landings. Female selectivity is flat-topped.
2. Bottom Trawl Discards. Female selectivity is dome-shaped.
3. Midwater Trawl, where catches included both landings and dead discards, the latter calculated according to the presumed discard mortality rate, since the length composition for retained and discarded catch were similar. Female selectivity is dome-shaped.
4. Hook & Line Landings. Female selectivity is flat-topped.
5. Hook & Line Discards, where the selectivity was mirrored to Bottom Trawl Discards since there were no size samples collected.
6. IPHC Survey. Female selectivity is flat-topped.
7. HBLL Outside Survey, where the selectivity was mirrored to the IPHC survey.
8. Synoptic Survey. Female selectivity is dome-shaped.
9. Recreational catch as recorded in the iREC survey (Internet Recreational Effort and Catch reporting program), selectivity was mirrored to Bottom Trawl Discards.
10. Salmon Bycatch, selectivity was mirrored to Bottom Trawl Discards.
11. HS MSA Survey, where selectivity was mirrored to the Synoptic survey.
12. Bottom Trawl CPUE, used as an index of abundance with selectivity mirrored to Bottom Trawl Discards.

Survey catch was also included in the model since it constituted a notable proportion of the total removals in recent years.
For each index series, catchability is an implicit parameter, which is calculated internally from the observed values and state variables in the model.

The model likelihood included a component for the indices of abundance from the surveys and fishery CPUE, using a lognormal distribution with the standard deviation calculated from the standardization method.

The multinomial likelihood was used for the length composition.
The sample size was input into the model.
Following a preliminary fit of the base model, the sample sizes were adjusted, i.e., downweighted, using the McAllister-Ianelli method in order to balance the variance between the length composition and the indices of abundance. 
These weighting factors were identical in all models.

The base model (labeled "A1") was fitted with the following structure:

- Two-sex model with length-at-age specified using the BC growth curve
- Maturity at age following the @taylor2013 ogive for the 2000s 
- Natural mortality fixed at 0.074
- Fit to all indices of abundance

### Sensitivity analyses

Additional sensitivity runs (relative to the base model) explored the impact of various modeling assumptions, particularly in the choice of biological parameters (maturity, growth, natural mortality), and index representing stock trend, on the estimated stock biomass.

The model names with the "A" prefix denote time-invariant natural mortality.

- A2: Length-at-age specified with the growth curve estimated in the US assessment [@gertseva2021]
- A3: Older maturity at age, specified by the [@mcfarlane1987] ogive
- A4: Use both the US growth curve and older maturity ogive
- A5: Assume 100 percent discard mortality 
- A6: Fit to only the IPHC index and fishery bycatch CPUE. These indices were grouped together since they describe a steady decline in the population over time.
- A7: Fit to only the Synoptic index
- A8: Fit to only the HBLL Outside index
- A9: Fix natural mortality to 0.05

The model names with the "B" prefix denote time-changing natural mortality. 
Several models were fitted to attribute the recent decrease in the indices to non-fishery mortality:

- B1: Estimate an increase in natural mortality starting in 1990 when the pinniped population, and hypothesized predation mortality on dogfish, started to increase [@olesiuk2018]. The increase is linear year over year. A single additional parameter is estimated.
- B2: Estimate an increase in natural mortality starting in 2010 as a stepwise change. A single additional parameter is estimated.
- B3: Estimate an increase in natural mortality starting in 2005 as a stepwise change.
- B4: Same as B1, but the natural mortality prior to 1990 is 0.05 (instead of 0.074)
- B5: Same as B2, but the natural mortality prior to 1990 is 0.05 (instead of 0.074)

### MCMC

After fitting the model by minimizing the negative log posterior, a subset of models was sampled with Bayesian MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) for general diagnostics purposes, for example, evidence of over-parameterization.
The No U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) algorithm was utilized using the adnuts R package [@adnuts].
A total of 3,500 iterations were used with a burn-in period of 1,000 iterations and thin rate of 5 to characterize the posterior on 2 chains. 

We proceeded with the MCMC for models A1 and B2. Results are presented in Appendix \@ref(app:mcmc).
Structural issues with the models explored here precluded the use of MCMC to produce probabilistic decision tables.
