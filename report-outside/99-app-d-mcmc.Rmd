# MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS {#app:mcmc}

Here, we present MCMC diagnostics and posteriors from model A1 (with constant natural mortality) and B2 (with stepwise increase in natural mortality in 2010).
For both models, adnuts reported good posterior behavior, as the effective sample size was high (ratio to the total MCMC iterations close to 1), Monte Carlo standard error low (less than 10 percent of the posterior standard deviation), and the $\hat{R}$ metric was below 1.1 for all parameters.
No divergence was detected in the NUTS algorithm.

Trace plots indicated low to no autocorrelation in the posterior with the thin rate of 5 (Figures \@ref(fig:trace-A1-1)--\@ref(fig:trace-B2-2)).
Marginal posterior distributions were approximately normally distributed, except for parameters with estimates near their respective bounds, for example, the $z_\textrm{frac}$ productivity parameter and the male apical selectivity parameters (all bounded between 0--1, Figures \@ref(fig:post-A1-1)--\@ref(fig:post-B2-2)). 
These parameters had skewed posteriors.

Correlation plots for the stock recruit parameters are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:corr-A1) and \@ref(fig:corr-B2).
Time series of the spawning output and depletion ($S/S_0$) are in Figure \@ref(fig:post-ts).
The estimate of $\log(R_0)$ in B2 is more uncertain than in model A1 and is manifested in the wider interval for spawning output for the former. 
The uncertainty in B2 is higher because the model is also attempting to estimate a change in natural mortality. Both parameters are positively correlated since a larger mortality rate requires a larger population to realize the historical catch.
